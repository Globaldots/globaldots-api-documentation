# Fittings and Fitting
The character fittings resource allows an application to both read and write to the saved fitting service. This does not have anything to do with actually fitting a ship, just the saved fits.

One of the really nice things about the CREST fitting service is that when a fit is added or deleted a notification is sent to any connected clients. This means if a character has their fitting window open and a fit is added through CREST the fitting window should be updated almost immediately.

## Fittings
### Route
``/characters/<characterID:characterIdType>/fittings/``

### GET
* Cache: 15 minutes
* Scope: `characterFittingsRead`

It is important to remember that adding or deleting a fit will not invalidate this cache. It is recommended that so long as you get the proper response code from CREST when you POST a new fit that you update any local cache at least temporarily.
